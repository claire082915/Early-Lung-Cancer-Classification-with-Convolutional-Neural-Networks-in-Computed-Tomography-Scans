# Early-Lung-Cancer-Classification-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-in-Computed-Tomography-Scans

In our code, we use an online dataset called Iraq-Oncology Teaching Hospital/National Center for Cancer Diseases (IQ-OTH/NCCD) lung cancer dataset, and through our model, which consists of convolutional layers, maxpooling layers, dropout layers, and fully connected layers, we were able to accurately classify the CT scans of the lung nodules into either normal lungs, benign tumors, and malignant tumors with up to 99% accuracy.
